(1) U32_Simulation is used for simulating the universal register machine U_32 with the two inputs g(x) and y.

(2) P-Lingua for SNPMR Pi_u is the P-Lingua translation file for the SNPMR system Pi_u simulating the universal register machine U_32.

(3) PI&U32_traces for g(x)=1 and y=1 is the computation traces of the universal SNPMR system Pi_u and the universal register machine U_32 for g(x) = 1 and y = 1.

(4) Supplementary Information for SNPMR systems provides more information about the tools for SNPMR systems concerning the P-Lingua language, syntactic parsing, and simulation algorithm.
